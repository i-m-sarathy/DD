<u><h4 >WELCOME TO SARASWATHI VIDHYASHRAM</h4></u>

Situated in a cool unpolluted area of Kavindapadi famous for its country- sugar market in Erode district, the campus is spread over 4.25 acres just off the<br> Kavindapadi-Sathi main road. This school is the vision of a group of educators, senior teachers, administrators, scientists, doctors, industrialists and builders<br> all of whom form The Board of Trustees of this institution. The primary sections of our school opened on the 4th of June 2003 with 100 students<br> and 9 teachers. We obtained recognition from the Government of Tamilnadu on 10.02.2004.

During the second academic year the strength increased to 225 students and 14 teachers and has now grown to the present strength of 1801 students from <br>nursery to 12th standard. We obtained higher secondary approval in May 2014 (Approval number: 09-M-012-0517 dated 05.2014).<br> The staff consists of a well qualified teaching faculty of 88 teachers and 60 non-teaching staff members.
